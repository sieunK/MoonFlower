Release Notes

Release 3.3.2 (Build - 2018120300)
Verified 3.6 compatibility.
Added an exception handler to ignore malformed regex expressions that the plugin has no control over.
Removed Office Mix tests as Office Mix has been discontinued.
Updated Behat tests to access site administration in the new way.
Updated Travis file to test multiple installs.

Release 3.3.1 (Build - 2018051500)
Fixed a unit test issue for Vimeo.
An extra check to deal with potential malformed provider endpoint URL.

For release 3.3.0, an xpath change was required in the Behat tests in order to get Behat to pass due to changes in Moodle's output.

For release 3.2, the plugin was rewritten to utilize the oembed provider definitions from http://oembed.com/providers.json.
The previous provider definitions that were hardcoded, but not present in the oembed provider list, were added as "local"
definitions to avoid regression errors.

Release 3.2.0.0 (Alpha)
Change highlights:
- Oembed providers defintions are downloaded from http://oembed.com/providers.json and stored in the Moodle database, rather than
code.
- Oembed defintions are refreshed nightly with new additions and deletions.
- Management screen allows for administrators to save provider defintions as local overrides not refreshed by oembed.com.
- Two types of tags can be used for filtering. The one desired can be configured.
- Lazy loading can be turned on or off; default is on. This can improve site performance.
- Provider management screen allows enable/disable, and edit as local as well as providing all of the provider information.
- A subplugin system is in place to allow providers not stored at oembed.com to define oembed information. Some of the existing
Microsoft providers have been rewritten as these.
